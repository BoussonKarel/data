# Become A Contributor

Anyone can contribute to WarpDrive. Contributing can be as simple as opening an issue or helping to track down the cause of one. Or as involved as contributing a fix, helping with routine maintenance, or implementing a big new feature. Even small PRs to fix or improve documentation are hugely beneficial, and our policy is to always work to review and merge PRs as quickly as possible. 

In addition to holding discussions on individual [issues](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues) or [RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/labels/T-ember-data), we coordinate work on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n8BptgFzNt)
