# Configuration

***Warp*Drive** is designed as a series of small packages and primitives with clear interface-driven boundaries between each other and brought together by configuration.

## Installation {#installation}

::: tip üí° *Warp***Drive** simplifies distribution using npm channel tags
- `@lts` | `@latest` | `@beta` | `@canary`
:::

To use ***Warp*Drive**, you will install `@warp-drive/core`, a cache[^1], and a reactivity system such as [emberjs](#ember), [TC39 Signals](#tc39-signals) or even [react](#react).

[^1]: We recommend using `@warp-drive/json-api` as your cache even if your API is not [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org).

:::

Complete your installation by installing and configuring the reactive framework of your choosing.

### Available Frameworks

- [ember](#ember)
- [react](#react)
- [svelte](#svelte) (üöß Coming Soon)
- [vue](#vue) (üöß Coming Soon)
- [TC39 Signals](#tc39-signals)

Don't see your framework listed yet? Reactive frameworks can typically be implemented in 15-30 lines of JS (before you add docs and types of course ;)). We're happy to add support for any framework that supports fine-grained signals based reactivity.

## Lockstep Versioning

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
We find this means its best to use exact versions instead of ranges as all WarpDrive packages should be upgraded together at once.
:::

*Warp***Drive** packages follow a lockstep versioning approach: all dependencies and peer-dependencies between the project's own packages are version-locked at the time of publish.

For instance, `@warp-drive/utilities@5.6.0` has a peer-dependency on `@warp-drive/core@5.6.0`. If any other
version were present (even a differing patch version such as `5.6.1`) it would create a conflict. All of the installation commands listed in this guide pin the version for this reason.


## Other Packages

*Warp***Drive** offers additional packages for features that don't quite meet the bar for being included
in core, or have been deprecated and removed from the core experience.

- `@warp-drive/utilities` provides commonly needed request builder, handler and string utils.
- `@warp-drive/experiments` provides bleeding edge unstable features we're prototyping like SharedWorker and PersistedCache
- `@warp-drive/legacy` provides extended life-support for features that have been removed from core.
