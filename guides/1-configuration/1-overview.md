# Configuration

***Warp*Drive** is designed as a series of small packages and primitives with clear interface-driven boundaries between each other and brought together by configuration.

## Installation {#installation}

Typically you will install `@warp-drive/core`, a cache, and a reactivity system such as [emberjs](#ember).

We recommend using `@warp-drive/json-api` as your cache even if
your API is not [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org).

::: tip üí° *Warp***Drive** simplifies distribution using npm channel tags
- `@lts` | `@latest` | `@beta` | `@canary`

:::

## Lockstep Versioning

*Warp***Drive** packages follow a lockstep versioning approach: all dependencies and peer-dependencies between the project's own packages are version-locked at the time of publish.

For instance, `@warp-drive/utilities@5.6.0` has a peer-dependency on `@warp-drive/core@5.6.0`. If any other
version were present (even a differing patch version such as `5.6.1`) it would create a conflict.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
We find this means its best to use exact versions instead of ranges as all WarpDrive packages should be upgraded together at once.
:::

All of the installation commands listed in this guide pin the version for this reason.

## Other Packages
